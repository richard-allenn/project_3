# project_3
the 3rd project

Inside the “crime data” folder there is 2 folders that contain our input csv data , cleaned output csv and the python code to facilitate the cleaning. 
This does not need to be run for our displays to work. 

Inside the “testing page” folder is the index3.HTML which opens, runs and creates a webpage displaying a chart of the crime data. This is made with chart.js 
Index4.HTML which contains the code for a webpage with two simple charts comparing crime data in 2007 and 2022. 
They require the logic file to be in the same folder to function 

App.py file creates the api link for the tables created in the create_table.sql

3 types of maps were attempted. All located within the Static folder. 
 - Heat map (Logic.js and leaflet_heat.js) used simpleheat JavaScript Library (https://github.com/mourner/simpleheat) 
 - - Geo.Json District map (logic2.js and district.js)
 - - Marker map (logic2 and basic_map.js)

The Powerpoint has the correct visualisations of 2 types of graphs (Geo.Json and the Marker). 

Overall a rewarding project, Richard and I have learnt alot about things we can improve and components that we gained an understanding of.
